README for zmdp

This C++ source code implements several approximate value iterations for
MDPs and POMDPs, including HSVI2 [6], RTDP [1], LRTDP [3], HDP [2],
and FRTDP [not yet published].  The software takes a problem specification
as input.  Currently supported specification formats are Tony Cassandra's
POMDP file format [4] and a new format for describing problems in the
racetrack domain from [1].

Special note: my implementations of some of these algorithms are based
on publications that necessarily left out a lot of detail.  It's quite
possible that my implementation differs from the original in important
ways.  The original authors have not signed off on my implementations:
use at your own risk.  (And please inform me if you find any errors.)

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

To get started please first follow the instructions in INSTALL.

The build process creates binaries in the bin/<os_name>/ directory:

zmdpSolve
  zmdpSolve generates an output policy for a solution algorithm and
  problem you select.  It runs the solution algorithm in an anytime
  fashion, periodically printing bounds on the value of the initial
  state to console so that you can monitor progress.  When the run ends,
  the final policy is output to the file you specify.  There are several
  options for how to end the run: you can specify a desired regret bound
  ('precision') for the output solution, specify a fixed timeout, or
  just use ctrl-C to interrupt the algorithm when you are satisfied (it
  will output the final policy before exiting).

  Run 'zmdpSolve -h' for a summary of the options and some examples.

zmdpBenchmark
  zmdpBenchmark tests performance for a solution algorithm and problem
  you select.  As the solution algorithm progresses, various statistics
  are logged, such as the algorithm's bounds on the value of the initial
  state, the number of backups so far, and periodic measurements of the
  solution quality in simulation.  The plotting tools in the src/tools
  directory can be used to plot performance based on the logs.

  Logged data includes:
  * bounds.plot: bounds on initial state, internal algorithm state such as
                   number of trials, number of backups, etc.
  * inc.plot:    logs periodic measurements of solution quality in simulation
  * sim.plot:    logs some of the simulation traces so you can get a
                   qualitative sense of how the policy changes

  Run 'zmdpBenchmark -h' for a summary of the options and some examples.

========================================================================
PLOTTING PERFORMANCE

There are several scripts in the src/tools directory, a few of which
are described here.  They are intended to produce performance plots
based on the logs output by zmdpBenchmark.  Sorry, these tools are
somewhat messier / less documented than the solver itself.

=== MAKEPLOT

usage: makeplot OPTIONS <results_directory>
   -h    Print this help
   -i    Plot bounds vs. number of top-level iterations
   -p    Generate postscript output

makeplot plots the upper bound, lower bound, and measured solution
quality at testing epochs in a single graph with a logarithmic x axis.
It looks in <results_directory> for the files bounds.plot and inc.plot,
output by solveMDP.  By default the plot is displayed in an X window.
Using the -p option drops it into a PostScript file instead, e.g. for
inclusion in a paper.

=== COMPAREPLOTS

usage: compareplots OPTIONS <dir1> <dir2>
   -h    Print this help
   -t    Plot bounds vs. time
   -i    Plot bounds vs. number of top-level iterations
   -s    Plot speed (iterations v. time)
   -p    Generate postscript output
  
compareplots shows solution quality vs. wallclock time for two
directories in a single plot.  Anytime solution quality bounds are not
shown with the default options.

=== SPEEDPLOT

Speedplot is similar to compareplots, but uses number of updates on the
x axis rather than wallclock time.  You may prefer this so that results
are less dependent on the platform used.  A downside is that the amount
of time required for each update varies widely depending on the search
strategy and especially on the bounds representation.

RELEASE NOTES

Changes from 0.2.1 to 0.3.0 (28 Apr 2006)

* Refactored code so that different problem types, search strategies,
  and value function representations can be mixed and matched.

* There are now separate binaries for benchmarking algorithms
  (with incremental policy evaluation) and just solving particular
  POMDPs (with policy output at the end).

* No longer split binaries for each solution algorithm -- there are too
  many combinations to have a different binary for each.

Changes from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1 (14 Apr 2006)

* Fixed problem with directory structure in tarball that broke
  compilation.

* Performance vs. number of updates for the HSVI algorithm is now
  output in the bounds.plot file in the same format as for other
  algorithms, suitable for plotting using the speedplot utility.

Changes from zpomdp 0.1 to zmdp 0.2 (27 Feb 2006)

* zmdp now includes MDP solving as well as POMDP solving
  capabilities (hence the name change).

* Created uniform MDP/POMDP API so that POMDPs formulated as
  belief-space MDPs can be passed to MDP heuristic search algorithms.

* Some code has been refactored to reduce code duplication and
  provide cleaner interfaces.  This involved shuffling directories.

* Implemented racetrack domain and some sample problems from the
  literature.

* Implemented RTDP, LRTDP, HDP, HDP+L, and FRTDP.

* Separate binaries are now produced for each (problem type, algorithm)
  pair rather than a single unified binary.

zpomdp 0.1.0 (28 Oct 2005)

* Initial release.
